to safe progress follow these steps:  
	1) export labels as VOC xml (zip file has to be unpacked after download)  
	2) import labels as VOC xml  

 ## general workflow:  
 1) literature review
 2) choose suitable deep learning algorithms (object detection/segmentation)  
 3) data preprocessing and image labeling
 4) model creation and training  
 6) model testing and validation  
 7) model application on orthophoto data
 8) write report
